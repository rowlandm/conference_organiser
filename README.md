# conference_organiser
This is the conference organiser for [#RSEAA24](https://rseaa.github.io/). You can also have a look at RSEAA23 and RSEAA22 on the same website.

We are just starting so there isn't much information.

See the wiki for details on things we have already started doing - https://github.com/rowlandm/conference_organiser/wiki/List-of-things-we-have-already-done-at-RSEAA24-that-need-to-be-added-to-the-conference-organiser

We would like to improve the sustainability of the process of organising the conference around some of the key areas such as: 
- Simplifying the way we can send our prospectus to potential sponsors who will provide us with funds to run the conference, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential keynote speakers, along with followup emails for people who accepted the keynote speaking opportunity, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential panelists, along with followup emails for people who accepted the opportunity, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential session chairs, along with followup emails for people who accepted the opportunity, 
- Simplifying the schedule, making it easy for participants to access, and simplifying the way we create Zoom meetings  
- Make it easy to point to other documentation and project management tools, 
- Make it easy to send out emails and social media or to have a schedule to make it easier
